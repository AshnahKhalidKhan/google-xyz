#### Resources used:
- https://pages.github.com/ (Project site > Start from scratch > Follow all instructions there).
- I need to make sure I use ReactJS or VueJS or some other fancy JS because I need to update the values being outputted multiple times.
- Another thing needed is to incorporate GitHub Actions because... why not? It's good practice for learning GitHub Actions and its workings.
- Okie dokie, learning the order of Git commands I need each to update this repository via this video by Net Ninja on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFcl_Fba-k
- So some GitHub commands and what they do I learned on the way:
git status -> tells me the branch I am currently in
git add . -> add all changes (that is what the dot in the end is for) to the Git staging area; it allows you to select which changes you want to include in your next commit. Without using git add, no changes would be recorded in the commit.
git commit -m "descriptive commit message" -> basically the actual command that commits all changes to the repository
git push origin <branch name> -> pushes all commits to the branch (in our case, branch name will be 'main'); basically updates the branch with all commits

#### Other random thoughts I get while working on this:
- I have realized when I first learn things, I need to watch the same videos multiple times sometimes before I understand them. What a roadblocker for progress, isn't it?
- I just got an email from HR... I need to commit this and take a moment to reflect on everything. This is huge.
